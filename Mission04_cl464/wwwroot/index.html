    <!-- paragraph about my hopes for the class -->
    <h3>Hopes for the class</h3>
    <p class="course">I am very excited for this class for several reasons. 
        The main reason is that many job listings that I have seen recently
        have C# listed under the job requirements. I hope this class will better help me
        not only learn C#, but also learn industry standards of application development.
        Programming has always been fun for me because I love challenges and problem solving.
        That being said, I look forward to the remainder of this course!</p>
